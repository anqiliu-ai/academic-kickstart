I am a [DOLCIT](http://dolcit.cms.caltech.edu/index.html) postdoctoral fellow in Department of Computing and Mathematical Sciences ([CMS](http://www.cms.caltech.edu/)) at California Institute of Technology ([Caltech](http://www.caltech.edu/)), working with [Prof. Yisong Yue](http://www.yisongyue.com/index.php) and [Prof. Anima Anandkumar](http://tensorlab.cms.caltech.edu/users/anima/).

I received my Ph.D. in [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.uic.edu/), University of Illinois at Chicago ([UIC](https://uic.edu/)). I was fortunate to have [Prof. Brian Ziebart](https://www.cs.uic.edu/Ziebart) as my advisor.

My research interest lies in machine learning and its applications. I am currently working on conservative prediction, domain shift, interactive machine learning.
